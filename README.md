# Handwritten-digit-classification-using-CNN
Handwritten digit classification using CNN - Build two Neural Networks capable to perform handwritten digits classification using the MNIST dataset. The first Network is a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the second one is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). when given an input our algorithm will say, with some associated error, what type of digit this input represents.
